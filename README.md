# The Cricketer
--------------

Wikipedia says "Sanchin Tendulkar is a former Indian cricketer and 
captain, widely regarded to be the gratest batsmen of all time".

This is how I _demostrate_ it.

## Installing

Just install the packages with NPM (maybe you could try with Yarn too)

```$ npm install```

Also define the PORT in your CLI vars

```$ export PORT=8089```

And that's all!

## Running

You can see the magic with

```npm start```
